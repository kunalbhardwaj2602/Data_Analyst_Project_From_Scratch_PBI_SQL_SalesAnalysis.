## SalesAnalysis_from_scratch_using_SQL and PowerBI
welcome!! 

## Task what I  performed.
   * We need to imporve our **Internet Sales Report** and want to move form **Static Reports** to **Visual Reports**
   * Essentially we want to focus it on how much we have **Sold of What Products** to **which Clients** and how it has been over time.
   * Seeing as each sales person works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to ** filter them also** .
   * We mmeasure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance .
   * The budget is for 2021 and we usally look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of sales.
